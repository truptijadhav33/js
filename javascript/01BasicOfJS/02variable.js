
//JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

/*
 1. var
 2. let
 3. const

The "var" keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
The "let" and "const" keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

   * You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const but in vae that can possible *
